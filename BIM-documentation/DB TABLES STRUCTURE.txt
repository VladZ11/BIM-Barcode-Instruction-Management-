## Table Usage Context

1. Core instruction tables (BIM_SMD_IM_*) store manufacturing instructions for PCB assembly.

2. Map-related tables (BIM_SMD_MAPS, BIM_SMD_MODULES, BIM_SMD_CONVERSION_MAPS) manage component positioning information for automated pick-and-place machines.

3. History table (BIM_SMD_IM_HISTORY) tracks all changes to instructions with complete snapshots, enabling audit trails and version comparison.

4. Note tables (BIM_SMD_IM_NOTE, BIM_SMD_IM_TYPICAL_COMMENT, BIM_SMD_IM_CATEGORY_NOTE) provide a structured system for adding comments and annotations to instructions, with categories for visual organization.
